# MySQLPortfolio
A portfolio showing all of the projects and work I have completed using SQL.

1. The first mini project I have completed is shown in the file SportingGoods.sql. This was a project assigned to me after using Khan Academy, taking part in their SQL course.
The project descrption was "Create your own store! Your store should sell one type of things, like clothing or bikes, whatever you want your store to specialize in. You should have a table for all the items in your store, and at least 5 columns for the kind of data you think you'd need to store. You should sell at least 15 items, and use select statements to order your items by price and show at least one statistic about the items."

2. SolarSystemKAL2.sql is the code written in SQL for the 2nd project on Khan Academy. This was part of the 'data dig' project.

3. Movie Stars.sql is the code written in SQL for the 3rd project on Khan Academy. This was the final project from Lesson 3: Relational queries in SQL.

4. Lessson4Project.sql is the code written in SQL for the 4th project on Khan Academy. This was the final project from Lesson 4: Modifying databases with SQL.
